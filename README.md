# Chrome Extension Boilerplate

A modern boilerplate for developing Chrome extensions using **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Material-UI (MUI)**. This project provides a strong foundation for building powerful and user-friendly Chrome extensions.

## Features

- **React** for building interactive UIs.
- **TypeScript** for type safety and better developer experience.
- **Material-UI (MUI)** for consistent and customizable UI components.
- **Hot Reloading** for a seamless development experience.
- **Optimized Build** for efficient production deployment.
- **Manifest V3** compatibility.
